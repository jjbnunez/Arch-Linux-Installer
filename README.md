# Arch-Linux-Installer

My personal version of the Arch installer script taken right out of the Mouseless Development book by Matthieu Cneude, found at https://themouseless.dev/

This repository is part of an ongoing personal project of mine to enrich my understanding of computers for fun! I love learning about operating systems. I hope someday to be able to design the right custom OS experience for me, and to be able to comfortably build upon that platform for myself.
